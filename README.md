1-2. Easy tasks.
3. Image from Pexels.com was too big so it was not loading. I decided to switch background-image: src element on background-image: url. The correct way would be if I just format the image to a proper size.

9. This task was very interesting. I didnt knew what command and where i should place it. First I started to searching for command that creates a pop-up menu and found window.alert command and put in my code. After the page was loaded the alert pops out and it gives me no choices except OK. I continued searching for a right command w3chools.com and messing up with my code trying to find what exactly each line of code is responsible for. When the right command was found i just needed to place it in the right spot.
10. Created :))
